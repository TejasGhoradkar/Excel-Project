Business Task
Use the Fitbit fitness tracker data to determine some smart device usage trends, how customers
can use them, and how they can affect marketing plans so that the Analytic team of WeFit can
offer business solutions and add new clients.

The data source used for this case study is FitBit Fitness Tracker Data This dataset was
downloaded from Kaggle where it was uploaded by MÃ¶bius

1. A company called leanfit which is a daughter company of WeFit sells personalized diet
plans and this company is generating less sales from the last few months and now they
want the Analytics team to find some potential customers who are most likely to buy their
personalized diet plans for weight loss.
As we know that before purchasing a weight loss diet plan It is a good idea to consult with
a healthcare professional, such as a doctor or registered dietitian, to ensure that it is safe
and appropriate for you. It is also important to consider your personal preferences, dietary
needs, and lifestyle when choosing a diet plan.
People of all ages, genders, and body types may choose to purchase a weight loss diet
plan. Some people may decide to purchase a weight loss diet plan because they are
unhappy with their current weight or because they want to improve their overall health.
Others may have a specific health condition, such as high blood pressure or diabetes,
that can be improved by losing weight. Some people may also purchase a weight loss
diet plan as part of a broader effort to improve their physical fitness or to train for a
specific event, such as a marathon or a bodybuilding competition. In general, anyone who
is interested in losing weight and improving their health may consider purchasing a weight
loss diet plan.
Now we know that If your BMI is 18.5 to <25, it falls within the healthy weight range. If
your BMI is 25.0 to <30, it falls within the overweight range. If your BMI is 30.0 or higher,
it falls within the obesity range.
Weight loss can also help to lower high blood pressure (hypertension). Losing excess
weight can reduce the strain on your heart and blood vessels, which can help to lower
your blood pressure. In addition, losing weight can help to improve other factors that
contribute to high blood pressure, such as high cholesterol levels, insulin resistance, and
inflammation.
Elevated heart rate is associated with elevated blood pressure, increased risk for
hypertension, and, among hypertensives, increased risk for cardiovascular disease.If your
heart rate exceeds 185 beats per minute during exercise, it is dangerous for you. If you
have high blood pressure, it is important to work with your healthcare team to develop a
plan for managing your condition. This may include lifestyle changes, such as following a
healthy diet and exercising regularly, as well as taking medications as prescribed. Weight
loss can be an important part of this plan, and it is often recommended for people with
hypertension.
Try to find the customers who are likely to buy this weight loss plan, you are given the
fit-bit fitness tracker data, analyze the data and find some potential customers for leanfit.

Currently they are selling in their stores but now they are going online to sell all the
products.
There are likely to be many different types of people who are interested in buying fitness
gear online. Some may be individuals who are already very active and looking to upgrade
or replace their existing gear, while others may be people who are just starting to get into
fitness and looking for affordable equipment to use at home.
A person who is already into fitness may be the one wearing the gear for more than 20
days and recording an average of more than 30 very active minutes. Similarly, if a person
wears the gear for more than 20 days and records an average of more than an hour of
fairly active minutes, that person can be considered someone who wants to get into
fitness.

fitness tracker data, analyze the data and find some potential customers for fitwear.

Sleep deprivation is a condition that occurs when you do not get enough sleep or have
poor quality sleep. It can have serious consequences for your physical and mental health,
as well as your daily functioning.

 At last WeFit wants its Analytic team to create a dashboard out of this data to present it in
front of their management team.
To do that we will only take the daily activity data and try to create a few charts and
graphs out of it.
1. First use the daily activity data and find the unique id of all the users.
2. Then find the number of days they use their fitness tracker.
3. Use this data to group all the users into Active(>20), moderate(>10,<20) and
light(<10) users.
(for example active user can be the one wearing the gear for more than 20 days)
4. After that find out the mean distance traveled by each user
5. Use this mean distance to group each user into Pro,Intermediate and
beginner.(set criteria by yourself)
6. Then find out the total steps traveled by each user
7. Then find out the calories burned by each user
8. And then find out their fairly active, lightly active and Very active minutes.
9. Repeat all these tasks (1 to 8) with respect to distinct dates (for example find out
unique dates instead of unique id and calculate number of users on that date).
10. Use this filtered data to create charts and graphs for better visualization.
